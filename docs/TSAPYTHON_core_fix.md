TSAPYTHON core.py local fix

Summary
-------
This note documents a local hotfix applied to the installed `tsapython` package in the project's virtual environment. The change fixes two issues that prevented the tinySA controller from initializing correctly:

1. A syntax bug in `mode()` (stray "+ +" in string concatenation) that raised a TypeError.
2. The serial-read helper `get_serial_return()` could block indefinitely if the tinySA did not return the expected prompt; a timeout was added to avoid hanging.

This file records what was changed, where the backup is, how to revert the change, and a suggested upstream patch/PR message.

Affected installed file
----------------------
Virtualenv site-packages path (current environment):

/Users/abdullaalhosani/.local/share/virtualenvs/tinysa-lo-characterization-6b-LePsQ/lib/python3.11/site-packages/tsapython/core.py

Backup (created before modification):

/Users/abdullaalhosani/.local/share/virtualenvs/tinysa-lo-characterization-6b-LePsQ/lib/python3.11/site-packages/tsapython/core.py.orig.20251027_011551

What was changed (exact snippets)
---------------------------------

1) In `mode(self, val1="low", val2="input")` the original faulty line was:

```py
writebyte = 'mode '+str(val1)+ + ' ' +str(val2)+'\r\n'
```

It produced a runtime error: "TypeError: bad operand type for unary +: 'str'" because of the stray `+ +`.

It was replaced with a correct and readable concatenation:

```py
# FIX: correct string concatenation â€” original had a stray "+ +" which
# caused a TypeError (unary + on string). Build the command string cleanly.
writebyte = 'mode ' + str(val1) + ' ' + str(val2) + '\\r\\n'
```

2) `get_serial_return()` previously blocked indefinitely while waiting for a prompt `>` and did not implement a timeout. It was replaced with a version that:
- Adds a `timeout` parameter (default 5.0 seconds).
- Returns whatever data has been received on timeout (possibly empty) and emits a warning message.
- Sleeps briefly in the loop to avoid CPU spin.

Why these changes
-----------------
- The `mode()` concatenation bug prevented the tinySA controller from configuring the device. Fixing it allows the command to be sent at runtime.
- The added timeout prevents the connect sequence from hanging indefinitely if the tinySA firmware or connection behaves unexpectedly (missing prompt, slow response, or partial responses). This makes the controller robust during automated runs and when devices are slow.

How to revert
-------------
To revert to the original installed file (undo the local patch):

```bash
VE="$HOME/.local/share/virtualenvs/tinysa-lo-characterization-6b-LePsQ"
CORE="$VE/lib/python3.11/site-packages/tsapython/core.py"
BACKUP="$CORE.orig.20251027_011551"

# Make sure backup exists
ls -l "$BACKUP"

# Restore
cp "$BACKUP" "$CORE"
```

After restoring, re-run the tinySA tests to confirm behavior. Be aware that restoring will reintroduce the original TypeError if the code path calling `mode()` is reached.

How to produce a tidy patch for upstream
---------------------------------------
If you want to submit this fix upstream to the `tsapython` project, create a unified diff (git-style) showing the change and open a PR with the following information:

- Title: Fix mode() string concatenation and add timeout to serial reads
- Description: Briefly explain the runtime TypeError caused by an extra `+` and the hang caused by indefinite serial reads; include a short example stack trace. Attach the patch and the unit test / reproduction steps if available.

Example (manual diff creation):

```bash
# Create a working copy of the patched file somewhere (or use git if available)
mkdir -p /tmp/tsapython-fix
cp "$CORE" /tmp/tsapython-fix/core.py
cp "$BACKUP" /tmp/tsapython-fix/core.py.orig

diff -u /tmp/tsapython-fix/core.py.orig /tmp/tsapython-fix/core.py > /tmp/tsapython-fix/0001-fix-mode-concat-and-timeout.patch

# Inspect patch
less /tmp/tsapython-fix/0001-fix-mode-concat-and-timeout.patch
```

Then open an issue/PR at the `tsapython` repository (GitHub) with the patch attached and the explanation.

Notes and caveats
-----------------
- These changes are local to the virtualenv and will be overwritten if `tsapython` is reinstalled or upgraded in that environment.
- The `get_serial_return()` timeout default is conservative (5s). You can increase it if your tinySA is slow to respond under certain conditions.
- The fix is intentionally minimal and focused on stability for our usage; the upstream project may prefer different error handling or API changes.
